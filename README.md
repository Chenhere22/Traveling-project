# Online traveling product analyse
The project consists of two sub-projects: European and China traveling. To launch fast, We will focus on one product, German speaker and English speaker going to China in the beginning. 

## The European travleing(listed here and analyse in another document)
This traveling focuses on Chinese travelers. My WeChat writing platform(公众号) will focus on German city introduction. The first article about Stuttgart have been read 2458 times and got 8 followers until 4. Feb. 2025. One follower sent message to me and I added his WeChat acount.

I will write this kind of articles each three days using my free time. The next city is Mannheim(location, eating, friend city of Chongqing, the first car statues and the creation of bicycle); Nuenburg(toy city, the biggest Christmas market, friend city of Shenzhen); the cities I will go there in person and can make a short video to show it.

## The China traveling
This traveling will be posted on Tiktok, Facebook, reddit, X, and Instagram. I have posted one video about traveling in China(7.2.2025). The orignal vedio I will ask my sister to make and I will add subtitles and audio. Then I can post on Tiktok and Instragram. Based on compititors' experience, Tiktok can attract more attention but limited people tend to travel in China. They mentioned Meta and Instagram are good place to post sales information.

## Marketing analysis
China is the second biggest international traveling markets for german tourists. 

In Germany, large tour operators like TUI have long been offering specialized travel products designed for inbound China travel. In addition, several independent German websites publish articles that explain Chinese culture in depth—although many of these platforms tend to focus more on cultural and historical narratives rather than showcasing China’s diverse natural landscapes (with some content not updated since 2022).

On the Chinese side, social media is buzzing with posts and groups that organize travel resources for tours into China. These platforms foster communities that share itineraries, insider tips, and local recommendations. However, while the marketing initiatives are often led by founders with extensive overseas experience, their insights tend to be narrowly focused on Chinese cultural elements. This results in a somewhat superficial understanding of non‐Chinese travelers’ preferences and a missed opportunity to develop richer, more globally inclusive experiences.

Furthermore, as digital technologies transform the travel industry—enabling AI-driven personalization and seamless mobile services—the current marketing strategies for inbound China travel could benefit from a more nuanced approach that not only leverages high-tech solutions but also broadens the appeal to international visitors by emphasizing the full spectrum of China’s attractions, including its natural scenery and diverse outdoor experiences.

German Travel agencies: Their products focus on the typical cities includes Peking, Shanghai, Xi'an, Yangtzi River, Guilin.They don't have highly attend the local lives. 
Chinese online travel platform: trip.com is used by asia travelers. 

### digital platform
Digital travel platforms also play a crucial role in shaping travel decisions on German market. in Germany and across Europe, leading platforms like Booking.com and Check24 have consolidated the online travel market. Booking.com, for instance, reportedly commands up to 72% of the European hotel booking market (as noted in industry analyses ), while meta-search engines like Trivago and Kayak continue to provide essential price comparisons that help travelers make informed decisions.

German market is undergoing a digital transformation that emphasizes personalization, real-time data, and seamless payment integration. This evolving landscape calls for a more nuanced marketing strategy that leverages digital platforms effectively while addressing the diverse expectations of German travelers.
