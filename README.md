# Traveling-project
The project consists of two sub-projects: European and China traveling. 
The most important of this business is finding customers.
## The European travleing
This traveling focuses on Chinese travelers. My WeChat writing platform(公众号) will focus on German city introduction. The first article about Stuttgart have been read 2458 times and got 8 followers until 4. Feb. 2025. One follower sent message to me and I added his WeChat acount.

I will write this kind of articles each three days using my free time. The next city is Mannheim(location, eating, friend city of Chongqing, the first car statues and the creation of bicycle); Nuenburg(toy city, the biggest Christmas market, friend city of Shenzhen); the cities I will go there in person and can make a short video to show it.

## The China traveling
This traveling will be posted on Tiktok. I have posted one video about traveling in China. The orignal vedio I will ask my sister to make and I will add subtitles and audio. Then I can post on Tiktok and Instragram.
